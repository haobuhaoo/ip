- for increment A-BetterGUI to generate new code.
Generally it works well, but sometimes it generates code
that isn't wanted, or is inconsistent with the rest of
the similar codes. It has helped to save me from manually
typing all the similar codes and JavaDoc comments.
- for increment A-MoreErrorHandling to generate equals()
and hashCode() methods, with JavaDoc comments. It also
helped with generating some of the error handling code.
It is interesting to know that it can predict what kinds
of code is needed, based on the context of the code.
